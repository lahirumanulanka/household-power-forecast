# Final Report (Structure Template)

## 1. Dataset Justification & Literature Review
(Summarize dataset + cite literature review document.)

## 2. Exploratory Analysis & Preprocessing
- Plots: raw series, decomposed components, missingness heatmap, outlier diagnostics.
- Handling of missing/anomalous values.
- Feature engineering summary.

## 3. Class Models
- Prophet setup + parameters.
- Amazon Forecast / Chronos setup.
- LSTM architecture (layers, sequence length, optimizer, training curves).

## 4. Advanced Model
- Chosen model (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformer) architecture & justification.
- Training details, hyperparameters.

## 5. Comparison & Error Analysis
- Metric table (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, RÂ²) across models.
- Error segmentation (by hour-of-day, weekday, volatility regime).
- Residual plots, forecast vs actual visualizations.

## 6. Critical Reflection
- Data limitations (single household, concept drift, missing intervals).
- Modeling challenges (minute-level noise, seasonality layering, memory constraints).
- Ethical considerations (privacy of consumption patterns, potential misuse in surveillance or discrimination if scaled to many households).
- Improvement avenues (ensembles, probabilistic intervals, external regressors like weather, demand response signals, hierarchical modeling with sub-meterings).

## 7. Reproducibility
- Config-driven pipeline description.
- Environment & dependency list.
- Random seed control.

## 8. Conclusion
- Key insights & best-performing model summary.
