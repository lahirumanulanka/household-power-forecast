### Model Performance Summary:

**Best Performing Models:**
- Tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM) typically show superior performance
- LSTM effective for capturing temporal dependencies
- Prophet provides good baseline with uncertainty quantification

**Model Strengths:**
1. **XGBoost/LightGBM**: 
   - Best for complex feature interactions
   - Fast training and prediction
   - Feature importance for interpretability

2. **LSTM**:
   - Captures long-term dependencies
   - Works well with raw sequential data
   - Flexible architecture

3. **Prophet**:
   - Automatic seasonality detection
   - Handles missing data well
   - Provides uncertainty intervals

4. **SARIMA**:
   - Statistical foundation
   - Well-established methodology
   - Works with limited data

**Model Limitations:**
- Deep learning requires more data and tuning
- Tree models may not extrapolate well
- Statistical models assume stationarity

**Recommendations:**
- Use ensemble of top models for production
- XGBoost for point forecasts
- Prophet for uncertainty quantification
- Regular retraining with new data
